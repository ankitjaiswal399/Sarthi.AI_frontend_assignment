POP-UP FORM -> For this task I have used jquery message box. It contains a draggable box and once open you can not do anything on webpage untill message box is closed.

Row updation -> For this purpose I have used jquery. Append() funtion of jquery is used to add row HTML in the HTML of table.

Roq Deletion -> For row deletion I have maintained a variable which have the row number. It starts with fetching all the rows which are next to the selected row. After that row ID's will be updated of each and every row next to the selected row. remove() is used to remove the HTML of the row.
